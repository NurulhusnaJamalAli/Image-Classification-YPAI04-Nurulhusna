# Image Classification YPAI04 Nurulhusna
 This is a Capstone Project titled Image Classification by Nurulhusna (YPAI04)

## Concrete Crack Classification 
 This project aims to develop an AI model for classifying concrete images as either having cracks or being crack-free. The objective is to identify potential cracks in concrete  structures early on to ensure the safety and durability of buildings. 

 ## Dataset Source
 The dataset used for this project can be found here. [[Concrete Crack Images for Classification](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2)]

 ## Requirements
 To work on this project, you will need the following requirements:

 1. Python or Jupyter Notebook, in this project I used Jupyter Notebook.

 2. Python Libraries: 

   - TensorFlow or Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.
   - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - NumPy: For numerical computations.
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
   - Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
   - TensorBoard: For visualizing the training process and performance.

 3. Dataset: Download the dataset from the given link: [Concrete Crack Images for Classification](https://data.mendeley.com/public-files/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/files/8a70d8a5-bce9-4291-bab9-b48cfb3e87c3/file_downloaded). Place the dataset in an      appropriate folder within your project directory, such as `data/`.

 ## Project Structure
 The project is structured as follows:

 YPAI04_Nurulhusna_CapstoneProject3.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code 
 data: Dataset 
 Capstone_Proj3.h5: The trained model saved in the .h5 format.
 Capstone_Proj3_model.pkl: Pickle file containing the label encoder used to map segmentation labels.
